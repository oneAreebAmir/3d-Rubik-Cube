# 3d-Rubik-Cube
Author: Areeb Amir. This HTML file, when opened in a web browser, renders a 3D cube rotating in response to mouse movements. The cube is constructed using nested <div> elements representing its various faces (top, bottom, and sides). CSS styles defined in the accompanying "style.css" file control the appearance and positioning of these elements. The cube's rotation is achieved using a JavaScript function that dynamically adjusts the CSS transform property in response to mouse movements. The cube's structure is defined with specific dimensions and its faces are differentiated by distinct colors and lines. CSS styles include selectors for various classes and pseudo-elements to create the illusion of a three-dimensional object. Overall, this code creates an interactive 3D cube visual that responds to mouse input, showcasing the capabilities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating dynamic web content.
